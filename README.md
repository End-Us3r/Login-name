# Login-name

This Java program prompts the user to enter their first name, last name, and a four-digit number. It then constructs a login name based on the user's input. The rules for constructing the login name are as follows:

    If the last name is five or more characters, the login name is constructed by taking the first five characters of the last name, the first character of the first name, and the third and fourth digits of the four-digit number.
    If the last name is four characters, the login name is constructed by taking the entire last name, the first character of the first name, and the third and fourth digits of the four-digit number.
    If the last name is three characters, the login name is constructed by taking the entire last name, the first character of the first name, and the third and fourth digits of the four-digit number.

The constructed login name is then printed to the console.
